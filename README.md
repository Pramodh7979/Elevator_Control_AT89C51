# 5-Floor Elevator Control System using AT89C51
This is a microcontroller-based simulation of a 5-floor elevator using the AT89C51, developed in Keil and simulated in Proteus.

This is a group project completed as a part of our embedded systems coursework. We collaborated on circuit design, coding, simulation in Proteus, and testing using the AT89C51 microcontroller.

## ðŸ”§ Features
-Password protected access
- Initial floor starts at ground
